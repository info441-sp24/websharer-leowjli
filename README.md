The deployed website on Render.com:
https://websharer-leowjli-a3.onrender.com

The additional piece of information I chose to let the users input is a dropdown for the type of website that they chose to share.

Some of the options are:
- Streaming Service
- Entertainment
- Social Media
- Blog, etc.

No one helped me with my code
