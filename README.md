The deployed website on Render.com:

The website that has this information: https://www.hulu.com/

Visual component changes:
The preview url button
- Made it more colorful for call to action
- added hover effects and cursor changes to indicate that users are hovered over the button
- added a active feature so that users know when they clicked it

The preview dropdown card
- added a box shadow color to make it visually appealing
- changed the <p> tag margins to make it more readable

The input bar
- expanded it (padding on all sides) to make it easier for users to input their links and make edits
- lengthened it to match the preview div length; more uniform

No other students helped me with my code
